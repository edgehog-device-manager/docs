As an example,\na possible Hardware Type description could be \"ESP32 with a GSM module\" or \"RaspberryPi 0 with an\nLTE modem\".\n\nEach Hardware Type can have one or more Hardware Type Part Numbers associated with it. This makes\nsure that the user is able to map, e.g., a new revision of the PCB to the same Hardware Type, since\ndifferent hardware with the same Hardware Type is assumed to be compatible. Usually (but not\nnecessarily) the Hardware Type Part Number is a code that is written on the PCB.","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#hardware-type"},{"type":"extras","title":"Device - Core concepts","doc":"A device is an entity connected to Astarte.

This\nmakes it so that the System Model is the fundamental identifier when it comes to software updates.\n\nA System Model has one or more System Model Part Numbers asociated with it, allowing to track newer\nversions of a product which do not change its main functionality. Usually (but not necessarily) the\nSystem Model's Part Number is delivered along with the device, or on the box containing it.\n\nDrawing again from our bike sharing example, e-bikes and electric scooters would have two different\nSystem Models, even if they use the same Hardware Type (e.g. an ESP32 with a GSM module). It is also\npossible that the e-bikes are further split into different System Models depending on the country\nthey are deployed in if, for example, the software has to conform to speed limitations which are\nspecific for each country.","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#system-model"},{"type":"extras","title":"Tags, attributes and groups - Core concepts","doc":"This section will deal with various types of properties that can be added to devices to identify\nand group them.","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#tags-attributes-and-groups"},{"type":"extras","title":"Tags - Core concepts","doc":"Tags are string values that can be freely attached to Devices. There is no predefined semantics so\nusers are free to use them as they see fit.\n\nSome examples of tags that can be assigned to the e-bikes or electric scooters in our examples\ncould be `out-of-order`, `test_machine` or `Upgraded Brakes`.","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#tags"},{"type":"extras","title":"Attributes* - Core concepts","doc":"*_This feature is planned for a future release_\n\nAttributes are namespaced key-value pairs that can be attached to Devices. The namespacing happens\nby prepending the namespace to the key using a colon as separator (i.e. `namespace:key`). This\nensures that the same key in different namespaces can be addressed unambiguously.\n\nThe attribute keys are always strings, while values support all the types [supported by Astarte\nInterfaces](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/latest/030-interface.html#supported-data-types).\n\nThe majority of attributes are automatically populated using different mechanisms depending on the\nnamespaces, but there's also the possibility of manually defining custom attributes for a specific\ndevice.\n\nThe supported namespaces are:\n\n- `edgehog-synthetic`: automatically populated with values coming from Device data that is derived\n  from Edgehog (e.g. Geolocation, System Model, Hardware Type, etc...)\n- `edgehog-policy`: automatically populated with Edgehog values which are imposed on the cloud side\n  (e.g. Geolocation disabled due to GDPR restrictions).\n- `astarte-values`: automatically populated with values coming from device-owned Astarte interfaces\n  using an [Attribute Value Source](#attribute-value-source) with type `astarte-value`.\n- `astarte-attributes`: automatically populated using the `attributes` map in the Device status\n  returned from Astarte AppEngine API. Since Astarte attributes don't provide a trigger mechanism,\n  these attributes are lazily populated and should be considered eventually consistent.\n- `custom`: user-defined key-value pairs which are manually assigned to a Device.\n\nNote that all values will be converted to a string when using them as attribute values","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#attributes"},{"type":"extras","title":"Attribute Value Source* - Core concepts","doc":"*_This feature is planned for a future release_\n\nAn Attribute Value Source populates the attributes of a Device according to some rule.\n\nCurrently, the only supported type of Attribute Value Source is `astarte-value`, which updates\nDevice attributes using a value from an Astarte interface.","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#attribute-value-source"},{"type":"extras","title":"Selector - Core concepts","doc":"A Selector allows selecting a subset of Devices based on their tags and attributes. The Selector\ncan be evaluated for a Device and return `true` if the Device matches the Selector and `false`\notherwise.\n\nEach Selector can be made of one or more filters, combined using `and` and `or` and (possibly)\nparenthesized. When no parenthesis are present, `and` has a higher priority than `or` in\nexpressions.\n\n#### Supported filters\n\n##### Tag filter\n\nCreated with the syntax `\" \" in tags`, it returns `true` if `value` is included in the Device\ntags. It's also possible to use a negative filter with `\"value\" not in tags`, in this case the\nfilter will match all Devices which _don't_ have the tag.\n\nAdditionally, Edgehog supports pattern matching on tags using the `~=` (matches) and `!~=` (not matches) operators:\n\n- `\" \" ~= tags`: returns `true` if any Device tag matches the specified pattern\n- `\" \" !~= tags`: returns `true` if no Device tag matches the specified pattern\n\nPattern matching supports two types of patterns:\n\n**Glob patterns** (using quoted strings):\n\n- `*` matches any sequence of characters\n- `?` matches any single character\n- Example: `\"sensor-*\" ~= tags` matches tags like `sensor-temperature`, `sensor-humidity`, etc.\n- Example: `\"dev?\" ~= tags` matches tags like `dev1`, `dev2`, `deva`, but not `device`\n\n**Regular expressions** (using `/pattern/` syntax):\n\n- Full regex support with standard regex metacharacters\n- Can be written with or without quotes: `/pattern/` or `\"/pattern/\"`\n- Example: `/^sensor-\\d+$/ ~= tags` matches tags like `sensor-123`, `sensor-007`\n- Example: `/temp(erature)?/ ~= tags` matches both `temp` and `temperature`\n\nNote that regex patterns (unquoted `/pattern/`) can only be used with the `~=` and `!~=` operators,\nwhile quoted strings work with all tag operators (`in`, `not in`, `~=`, `!~=`).\n\n##### Attribute filter*\n\n*_Note that while Attribute filters are already supported, Attributes are going to be available in a\nfuture release_\n\nCreated with the syntax `attributes[\" : \"]    `, it returns `true` if\nthe value of the chosen attribute satisfies the expression.\n\nThe supported operators are:\n- `==` and `!=` for all value types\n- `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` for numeric or `datetime` values\n\n` ` can be a boolean (`true` or `false`), a string, a number (either integer or float), or one\nof the values supported using special syntax:\n\n- `now()` indicates the current datetime at the time the Selector is evaluated. This can be used to\n  do comparisons with other `datetime` attributes.\n- `datetime(\" \")` is used to pass `datetime` values in expressions. The string\n  contained in double quotes must be a valid UTC ISO8601 timestamp. Example:\n  `datetime(\"2022-06-27T16:27:40.254795Z\")`.\n- `binaryblob(\" \")` is used to pass `binaryblob` values in expressions. The\n  string contained in double quotes must be a valid Base64 encoding of the binary value. Example:\n  `binaryblob(\"Zm9vYmFy\")` to encode the string `\"foobar\"`.\n\n##### Attribute inclusion filter*\n\n*_This feature is planned for a future release_\n\n- `\" \" in attributes[\" : \"]`: returns `true` if `value` is included in the\n  chosen attribute. Note that the attribute must be an array for the expression to be valid.\n  \n#### Examples\n  \nTo provide some examples, here is a Selector to target all out of order Devices in Milan:\n\n```\n\"out-of-order\" in tags and attributes[\"edgehog-synthetic:city\"] == \"Milan\"\n```\n\nHere is a selector to target all Devices that have their service timestamp in the past so they have\nto be serviced, imagining this information is contained in the `com.foo.ServiceInfo` Astarte\ninterface in the `/serviceTimestamp`:\n\n```\nattributes[\"astarte-values:com.foo.ServiceInfo/serviceTimestamp\"] <= now()\n```\n\n#### Caveats\n\nNote that numeric values are conflated in a single numeric type, i.e. a selector with\n`attributes[\"custom:foo\"] == 42` will match either if `foo` is `integer`, `longinteger` or `double`\n(e.g it will also match `42.0`).\n\nAnother important thing to notice is that using an Attribute Filter will implicitly match only\nDevices that have that attribute. As an example, if there are 3 devices, one with attribute `foo:bar\n== 42`, the other with attribute `foo:bar == 3` and the third one with no `foo:bar` attribute, the\nAttribute Filter `attributes[\"foo:bar\"] != 42` will match the second Device but _not_ the third one,\nsince it doesn't have the target attribute.\n\nIn the future, additional syntax could be added to Selectors to allow filtering based just on the\npresence or absence of an attribute.","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#selector"},{"type":"extras","title":"Group - Core concepts","doc":"A Group represents a subset of devices filtered by a Selector.\n\nThe Group can be used to perform operations on Devices contained in it.\n\nSince Tags and Attributes of a Device can change, Groups do not statically define the set of Devices\nthey contain but they change dynamically following Device changes.\n\nNote that a Device can't be manually assigned to a Group, its tags and attributes must be\nused to make it satisfy the group Selector.","ref":"core_concepts-1.html#group"},{"type":"extras","title":"Hardware Types","doc":"<!---\n  Copyright 2021,2022 SECO Mind Srl\n\n  SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n-->\n\n# Hardware Types\n\nFor each hardware type the following information can be displayed and edited.\n\n* Name: a user friendly name, such as \"Strawberry Pi 5\"\n* Handle: a machine friendly identifier, such as \"strawberry-pi-5\" (it must be a lower case, alpha\nnumeric string, with no spaces and dashes allowed in the middle)\n* Part Numbers: a list of part numbers, such as \"STBEPI-5-MA-2GB-REV1\",\"STBEPI-5-MB-8GB-REV1\",\n\"STBEPI-5-MB-8GB-REV2\", etc...

The minimum allowed value is **6 000 000 bytes** (≈6 MiB).\n\n- **Memory Reservation**: A _soft_ memory limit, also specified in **bytes**. It serves as a hint to Docker and the kernel about how much memory the container should typically use.\n\n  - It must always be **less than the hard Memory limit**.\n  - The container can still use memory up to the hard limit.\n  - When the host is under memory pressure, Docker attempts to reclaim memory so that the container stays near or below the reservation value.\n\n- **Memory Swap**: Defines the total amount of **RAM + swap**, in **bytes**. This value only has effect if **Memory** is also set.\n\n  **Rules:**\n\n  - If **Memory Swap** is **set to a positive integer**:\n\n    - **Memory** must also be set.\n    - **Memory** = maximum RAM (bytes).\n    - **Memory Swap** = total (RAM + swap), in bytes.\n\n    **Example:**\n\n    ```\n    Memory = 314572800 bytes       (≈300 MiB)\n    Memory Swap = 1073741824 bytes (≈1 GiB)\n    ```\n\n    → Total allowed = 1 073 741 824 bytes\n    → Swap size = 1 073 741 824 − 314 572 800\n    → ≈ 758 MiB of swap.\n\n  - If **Memory Swap = 0**\n    → Ignored; treated as **unset**.\n\n  - If **Memory Swap = Memory** and Memory > 0\n    → Container has **no swap access** (RAM only).\n\n  - If **Memory** is set and **Memory Swap is unset**\n    → Total allowed memory = **Memory × 2**, half RAM, half swap.\n\n    **Example:**\n\n    ```\n    Memory = 314572800 bytes\n    ```\n\n    → Total = 629 145 600 bytes\n    → 314 572 800 RAM + 314 572 800 swap.\n\n  - If **Memory Swap = -1**\n    → **Unlimited swap**, up to the host’s available swap space.\n\n* **Memory Swappiness**: controls how aggressively the kernel swaps out anonymous memory pages used by a container. It’s a percentage between 0 and 100.\n\n  - `0` – turn **off** anonymous page swapping for the container.\n  - `100` – allow **all** anonymous pages to be swappable (most aggressive swapping).\n  - If not set – the container **inherits** the host’s swappiness value.\n\n* **CPU Period**: sets the **CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period** for a container: the length of each CPU scheduling window, in microseconds. It’s used together with `CPU Quota` to control how much CPU time a container can use in each period.\n  - Default: `CPU Period = 100_000` (100 ms).\n  - `CPU Quota` is the number of microseconds of CPU time allowed per period.\n  - Effective CPU share = `CPU Quota / CPU Period`.\n* **CPU Quota**: sets a **hard upper limit on CPU time** a container can use per CFS period (used with `CPU Period`).\n* **CPU Real-Time Period**: configures the **real‑time scheduler period** for a container, in microseconds. It works together with `CPU Real-Time Runtime` and requires special kernel/daemon setup.\n\n  - It sets the **length of the real‑time scheduling period** for a container.\n  - `--cpu-rt-runtime` then specifies how many microseconds within that period the container may run at real‑time priority.\n  - Both values **cannot exceed** the limits configured on the daemon/parent cgroup, and require the host kernel to support real‑time scheduling with `CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED`.\n\n    #### Requirements\n\n    To use `--cpu-rt-period`/`--cpu-rt-runtime`:\n\n    1. Kernel must have `CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED` enabled.\n    2. Docker daemon must be started with real‑time runtime configured, e.g.:\n\n    ```bash\n    dockerd --cpu-rt-runtime=950000\n    ```\n\n* **CPU Real-Time Runtime**: See explanation for `CPU Real-Time Period`\n\n#### **Security & Capabilities**\n\n![Security & Capabilities Section](assets/container_create_security_&_capabilities_section.png)\n\nControl container privileges and security-related settings.\n\n- **Privileged Mode** – gives a container almost the same power as the host, bypassing most isolation. Use it only when absolutely necessary.\n  Makes these changes for the container:\n\n  - Enables **all Linux kernel capabilities** (no capability dropping).\n  - Disables the **default seccomp** profile.\n  - Disables the **default AppArmor** profile.\n  - Disables the **SELinux process label**.\n  - Grants access to **all host devices**.\n  - Makes `/sys` **read‑write**.\n  - Makes **cgroups mounts read‑write**.\n\n  In other words, the container can then do almost everything the host can do.\n  Recommended practice:\n\n  Avoid --privileged for normal workloads.\n  Prefer adding only the specific capabilities you need with `Cap Add`.\n\n- **Cap Add**: add specific Linux kernel capabilities to a container, instead of giving it full privileges with `Privileged`. For list of available capabilities refer to the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)\n- **Cap Drop**: Remove default capabilities.\n\n#### **Runtime & Environment**\n\n![Runtime & Environment Section](assets/container_create_runtime_&_environment_section.png)\n\nSet runtime behavior and environment variables.\n\n- **Restart Policy** – Define what happens if the container exits.\n  Supported policies:\n\n  - `No` (default)  \n    Don’t automatically restart the container.\n\n  - `On Failure`  \n    Restart only if container exits with a non‑zero status.\n\n  - `Always`  \n    Always restart if the container stops.  \n    If manually stopped, it’s restarted only when the Docker daemon restarts or you manually start it again.\n\n  - `Unless Stopped`  \n    Like `always`, except if the container is stopped (manually or otherwise), it isn’t restarted after a Docker daemon restart.\n\n- **Environment Variables** – JSON array of environment variables in `\"key\": \"value\"` format\n\n#### **Device Mappings**\n\n![Device Mappings Section](assets/container_create_device_mappings_section.png)\n\nExpose specific host devices to the container.\n\n- **Device Mappings** – Map host devices into the container (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`).\n  Useful for hardware-dependent workloads.\n\n> **Note:** On the right side of every field there is ![Field Help](assets/help_icon.png) icon.

For this reason, we leave that responsibility to the forwarder by setting a slightly higher timeout here, such as 2 minutes.\nWhen changing the value, one should also evaluate the implications on connections to Edgehog's frontend and backend.
